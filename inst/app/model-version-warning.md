The New Hospital Programme (NHP) demand model has changed over time, preventing comparisons between different model versions.

A key reason for this is that over time the types of potentially mitigatable activity (TPMA) included in the model have changed. 

The full documentation of all model version can be found at the [model updates page on the NHP Project Information site](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/project_plan_and_summary/model_updates.html).
