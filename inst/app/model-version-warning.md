The New Hospital Programme (NHP) demand model has changed over time, preventing comparisons between different model versions.

A key reason for this is that over time [the types of potentially mitigatable activity (TPMA) included in the model](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/user_guide/mitigators_lookup.html) have changed. 

See [documentation of all TPMAs](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/modelling_methodology/activity_mitigators/inpatient_activity_mitigators.html) the NHP project information site, along with detail of [model version updates](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/project_plan_and_summary/model_updates.html).
