## Model version restriction

The New Hospital Programme (NHP) demand model has changed over time, preventing comparisons between different model versions.

A key reason for this is that over time <a href="https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/user_guide/mitigators_lookup.html" target="_blank"> the types of potentially mitigatable activity (TPMA) included in the model</a> have changed. 

See <a href="https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/modelling_methodology/activity_mitigators/inpatient_activity_mitigators.html" target="_blank"> documentation of all TPMAs</a> the NHP project information site, along with detail of <a href="https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/project_plan_and_summary/model_updates.html" target="_blank"> model version updates</a>.

We only allow comparisons on scenarios whose model version is greater than v3.1 as this represented a step change in the modelling methodology regarding activity avoidance TPMAs. Please see the relevant guidance <a href="https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/project_plan_and_summary/model_updates.html#v3.1" target="_blank"> here</a>.
