The NHP demand and capacity model is probabilistic – Each scenario is comprised of many simulations / runs (the default is 256 simulations). For each of the 256 simulations, parameter values are randomly sampled from the prediction intervals (TPMA assumption ranges) supplied as the model inputs. This results in 256 potential future outputs. The principal projection is the average (mean) of all of these outputs.
