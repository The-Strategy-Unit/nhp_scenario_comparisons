## Introduction and purpose

Welcome to the New Hospital Programme (NHP) scenario comparison tool. This tool allows NHP schemes to compare their demand modelling scenarios to one another. This is based on the existing visualisation in the <a href="https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/outputs/" target="_blank">main outputs app</a>, providing side-by-side versions of the visualisations and figures therein. The documentation for the demand model is available <a href=https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/ target="_blank">here</a>. 

## Instructions

To use the app, please first select which scheme’s results you wish to view.

Select one model scenario ('scenario 1') from the drop-down list, then select the model scenario you wish to compare it to ('scenario 2').

If needed, use the 'scenario runtime' drop-down to specify which of multiple scenarios with the same name you wish to use.
