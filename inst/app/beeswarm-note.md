Each circle (coloured by scenario) plotted on the beeswarm represents the result of a single simulation of the model and therefore a possible future based on the uncertainty in the input assumptions provided. 

The dashed vertical lines indicate the principal projection for each scenario; the solid vertical grey lines indicate the baseline value. 

Note: presently the ED counts exlcude Type 4 and Type 5 records. These will be added in due course.
