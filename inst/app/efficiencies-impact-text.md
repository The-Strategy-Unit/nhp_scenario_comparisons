This bar charts displays the estimated impact at the model horizon of each TPMA on efficiencies. However it does not account for interaction effects between TPMAs caused by overlaps between some efficiency TPMA cohorts. This means that the impact attributed to each individual TPMA may be slightly overstated. The overall size of this interaction effect can be viewed in the ‘step_counts’ sheet of the Excel download of the results (see ‘Downloads’ in the navbar of the Outputs app).
