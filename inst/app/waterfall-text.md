This chart shows the impacts of different factors on activity changes between the model baseline and in the model horizon years based on the principal projection.

Yellow bars are used to indicate the impact of factors which are increasing projected activity relative to the baseline year.

Black bars are used to indicate the impact of factors which are reducing projected activity relative to the baseline year.

The principal projection of activity in the horizon year is shown as the red bar at the bottom of the chart.

The “model interaction term” shows the effects of factors compounding within the model.

Note that the decomposition of activity changes over the model factors impact of changes should be viewed as indicative rather than precise exact figures.
