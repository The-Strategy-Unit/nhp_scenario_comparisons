## Scenario names

It is possible that a scenario name is duplicated, which is why a scenario datetime must also be provided. We remind the user of <a href="https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/user_guide/naming_scenarios.html/" target="_blank">the guide to good model naming practice</a> to avoid confusion when selecting scenarios for comparison.

To ensure that the user selects a unique scenario, we have included drop downs for both the scenario name and the model run time.
