# `supporting_data/`

This folder should contain supporting data files only. Results data are fetched separately from Azure as part of the `populate-final-report.R` script.

## Lookups

The folder contains:

* `scheme-lookup.csv` looks up scheme names and codes and also contains full trust names.

And copied here from [nhp_outputs](https://github.com/The-Strategy-Unit/nhp_outputs) are:

* `nhp_outputs/inst/golem-config.yml` for its POD measures lookup
* `nhp_outputs/inst/app/supporting_data/mitigators.json` for its mitigator code/name lookup
* `nhp_outputs/inst/app/supporting_data/tx-lookup.json` for its treatment-specialty code lookup
